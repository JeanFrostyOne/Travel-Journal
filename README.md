**BRIEF DESCRIPTION**

**This React project, "My Travel Journal", is a simple web application designed to display and practice rendering an array of data. Users can browse through cards detailing various destinations they have visited or plan to visit around the world. Each card includes an image of the location, description, visit dates, and a link to Google Maps to view the location. This basic project was created to practice dynamic data rendering with React, making it a great example for anyone looking to learn and implement array rendering in their own applications**

**FEATURES**

- **Component-Based Architecture:** _The project is built using reusable React components, ensuring ease of maintenance and scalability_
- **Dynamic Data Rendering:** _The application dynamically renders information for each card from an external data file, simplifying the process of updating and adding new destinations without the need to alter the component code_
- **Responsive Design:** _The layout is designed to be comfortable for viewing on both large screens and mobile devices, ensuring a wide accessibility_
- **Interactivity:** _The ability to navigate to Google Maps for a detailed view of the location enhances the interactive user experience_

**TECHNOLOGIES**

- **React:** _Utilizes the latest React features for building the user interface_

- **CSS:** _Styles components to create a unique visual appearance for the application_

- **External Data:** _The cards' information is loaded from an external JavaScript file, facilitating content management. Special attention is given to the dynamic rendering of the array from the data, allowing the application to efficiently handle updates and modifications to the list of destinations without requiring significant changes to the codebase. This approach not only streamlines content management but also showcases the flexibility and power of React in building dynamic user interfaces_

`export default function Cards() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      {data.map((item, index) => {
        return <Card item={item} key={index} />;
      })}
    </div>
  );
}
